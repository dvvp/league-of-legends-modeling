### Framing the Problem

In our [exploratory data analysis](https://dvvp.github.io/league-of-legends-eda/) done previously, we found that killing more dragons in [League of Legends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Legends) correlated to higher team kills. This time, we will be answering a binary classification problem using match wins as our response variable. 

Question we plan on investigating:

- Can mobile objects (MOBs) kills predict League of Legends match wins?

We chose this response variable because it is the most important when it comes to playing in a League of Legends tournament. The main goal for playing in a League of Legends tournaments is to win which means we must discover how League of Legends players win and lose.

Since the classes are balanced (i.e., predicting a win and predicting a loss is of equalimportance), we will choose accuracy as our evaluation metric.
